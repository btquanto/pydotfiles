This is intended for my personal use. If you want to use it, follow the following steps.
This works in Ubuntu 20.04. I don't guarantee other operating systems. It generally would work fine in bash shell and any derivatives.

1. The templates for the dotfiles are in the folder `dotfiles`. Edit them as fit.
2. Run `install.sh` and follow the instructions

Copy and paste for the lazy me:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/btquanto/dotfiles.git
    ./dotfiles/install.sh
